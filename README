Description :
***********
	This files gives the information about all the changes done to implement
the concat system call from a user land program. The user inputs certain flags and modes
along with the input files and output file and the system call implemented as a loadable
module will append or create and concat or truncate depending on the modes and flags passed
by the user.

The files used to implement this functionality are
	1. xhw1.c
	2. sys_xconcat.c
	3. header.h

The 'Makefile' is used to compile and build the user land program(xhw1.c).
The system call is loaded into the kernel by using the command "sh installsh install_module.sh"

Here sys_xconcat.c is a loadable system call.	

User land module:
*****************
	The user program takes all the inputs that are given by the user through the
command prompt and passes them in a structure to the kernel module.
The following arguments are packed in the structure.
	i.	output file
	ii.	input files
	iii.	number of input files
	iv.	flags to tell the behaviour of system call
	v.	permissions for the output file
	vi.	special flags

The below assumptions are made while passing the struct to the kernel module.
	a. If the user doesnt input any flag then by default 'append' is performed.
	b. If the user gives a non octal number then we will get an error saying the 
		mode is invalid.
	c. If the user doesnt input any mode then by default '755' mode willbe given for
		the output file to be created.
	d. The names of the input files and output files are mandatorily to be given by the user. 
 
The below flags are the possible inputs.
        1. -a : Append Mode (O_APPEND)
        2. -c : Create Mode (O_CREAT)
        3. -t : Truncate Mode (O_TRUNC)
        4. -e : Exclusive Mode (O_EXCL)
        5. -m ARG : Permission mode
        6. -A : Atomic Concat mode
        7. -N : Number of files written
        8. -P : Percentage of bytes written


System call module:
*******************
	The system call is implemented by 'sys_xconcat.c' file. It is loaded as a module into the kernel.
The system call is implemented in two modes - Normal mode and Atomic mode. The 'Atomic mode' is implemented 
when the user gives 'A' flag. 

The special behaviour in atomic mode is that when writing the input files into the output file if any 
error occurs then we will not change the outputfile and return an error to the user. This functionality is implemented by 
using a 'temp' file. Initially the output file is copied into the temp file and all the operations are performed on the temp
file and if the process is success then we will rename the temp file as the output file. And if any failure occurs then 
we will unlink the temp file and return the error.

The following validations are performed in the system call before doing any operation
	a. The passed argument length should be a valid one.
	b. The given output file should not be null
	c. The number of input files shouldnt be 0 and should also not be more than 10
	d. Input file and output file should be different.
	e. Passed mode should be valid
	f. Failure or success is checked in all the operations -Read/Write/Open
	g. User should have all the permissions

All the main validations are done in a seperate function called 'validateInputs'         

The xconcat and validate functions takes the void* pointer and length of the struct variables sent from the user land.


If any error is occured then we will be passing the error number to the user program where the appropriate error is displayed.
